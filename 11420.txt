If youre readin this. You know me.
You know me as grobb. Corey. Cameron. Ava. 
Whatever the fuck. I'm sorry. 

I'm not alive anymore.

On 11/9/20, I committed suicide.
My friends and family were my fuel. But I lost my 
friends. I dont want to go anymore.

I loved doing what I did. Working. People 
appreciated this said work. It kept me going. It
made me feel included and loved. Now, everything
is gone. I'm finished here. 
If you expected more, this is where this note ends.
I'm deeply sorry. No, I really am. I hope to see you
after I do this. 

I LOVE YOU AND GOOD NIGHT
